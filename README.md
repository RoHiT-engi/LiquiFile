# LiquiFile

  </t>File transfer between different devices (eg:- mobile, desktop, tablets, laptops) is not an easy task as we have to make use of a file transfer software which requires giving various permissions to the software in order to work, and other options are either using WhatsApp on both devices to transfer a file or transfer file with the help of USB cable. Our website helps in the seamless transfer of files to different types of devices by generating a QR Code which when scanned automatically downloads the files present in the QR Code in no time.</br>

  </t>Another use case is that many times when we have to download any kind of document we have to visit the website multiple times. This problem can be solved by making QR codes of mostly used documents that can be scanned with any device so that time is not consumed and many people can just scan the QR Code and download it without any hassle.
